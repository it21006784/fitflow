Brief Description of your Solution -
We have tasked with developing a social media platform tailored for fitness enthusiasts, enabling them to share their fitness journey, workouts, and healthy lifestyle tips. The platform will allow users to upload up to three photos or videos showcasing their fitness activities, workouts, and progress, with options to add descriptions. Users can also share updates on their current workout status, utilizing predefined templates for tracking progress. Additionally, they can share their workout and meal plans, with options to customize and update them over time. The platform will support user interactions such as liking and commenting on posts, with post owners having control over deleting comments. Profiles will be available for users to display their fitness-related activities, and they can follow other users' profiles. Notifications for likes and comments will be provided, prioritizing user-friendliness and simplicity. The platform will be developed as a Java (Spring Boot) based REST API and a React-based client web application, with plans for future mobile applications. Users will also have the ability to log in to the platform.
